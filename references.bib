	abstract = {This paper presents a review of the different International Maritime Organization ({IMO}) initiatives to improve the ship energy efficiency of new and existing ships, which is considered one of the essential tasks to reduce Greenhouse Gas ({GHG}) in the maritime industry. First, the {IMO} effort and initiatives and the different indices suggested by the {IMO} are presented till the last version of the Marine Environment Protection Committee ({MEPC}), showing the effect of different technologies on reducing the level of indices and the suggested improvement of the terms of indices in the next years. Second, the short- and long-term strategies suggested by the {IMO} are presented, showing that the effect of indices will be noticed in the short term, while the new fuels will show a significant improvement in the long term. Finally, several examples of cooperation between the different organizations are presented, showing that transferring knowledge and experience will significantly impact the maritime industry and thus lead to the concept of green ships in the near future. This paper shows that the combination of different solutions, the cooperation between stakeholders and the sharing of the data and information are important to achieve the required goal.},

ABSTRACT = {Global maritime transportation is responsible for around 3% of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and significant proportions of SOx, NOx, and PM emissions. Considering the predicted growth in shipping volumes to 2050, greenhouse gas emissions from ships must be cut by 75–85% per ton-mile to meet Paris Agreement goals. This study reviews the potential of a range of alternative fuels for decarbonisation in maritime. A systematic literature review and information synthesis method was applied to evaluate fuel characteristics, production pathways, utilization technologies, energy efficiency, lifecycle environmental performance, economic viability, and current applicable policies. Alternative fuels are essential to decarbonisation in international shipping. However, findings suggest there is no single route to deliver the required greenhouse gas emissions reductions. Emissions reductions vary widely depending on the production pathways of the fuel. Alternative fuels utilising a carbon-intensive production pathway will not provide decarbonisation, instead shifting emissions elsewhere in the supply chain. Ultimately, a system-wide perspective to creating an effective policy framework is required in order to promote the adoption of alternative propulsion technologies.},

abstract = {The environmental problems brought by the shipping industry have drawn the attention of all parties, making it critical to select a fuel system that combines economic and environmental benefits when ordering new ships. This paper narrows down a list of fuels to four high-potential options: LNG, methanol, hydrogen, and ammonia. Based on the dual perspectives of shipowners and the public, this study takes different-sized ships as the object, establishes mathematical models throughout their life cycle, and selects a variety of indicators to evaluate alternative fuels. The findings demonstrate that, in the short term, heavy fuel oil with scrubbers is the most economically advantageous option for all sizes of container ships, but methanol is a desirable alternative when taking into account the social cost of pollutants. Hydrogen might be the ultimate fuel to reduce emissions in the long run when the price gap closes.}

abstract = {Nuclear energy can play a very significant long-term role for meeting the world’s increasing energy demands, while simultaneously addressing challenges associated with global climate and environmental impact. Many nations of the world, particularly the Asia/Pacific Rim countries, are actively engaged in a major expansion of their nuclear energy complex. The degree to which nuclear energy can address long-term energy needs, either globally or regionally, will be dictated by the pace and adequacy of technical and policy solutions for waste, safety, security, and non-proliferation issues, as well as the capital cost of construction. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) could successfully address several of these issues. SMRs offer simpler, standardized, and safer modular design by being factory built, requiring smaller initial capital investment, and having shorter construction times. The SMRs could be small enough to be transportable, could be used in isolated locations without advanced infrastructure and without power grid, or could be clustered in a single site to provide a multi-module, large capacity power plant. This paper summarizes some of the basic features of SMRs for early deployment, several advanced SMR concepts, and points out the benefits and challenges in regulatory, economical, safety and security issues.}

ABSTRACT = {The decarbonization of the energy industry is one of the key pillars in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere. The energy generation industry is an important driver in the development of nations. Small modular reactors (SMRs) are considered an affordable energy generation technology that can provide clean energy that is comparable to other renewable energy technologies. However, several critical issues are established in the full adoption of and investment in SMRs in developing nations. A state-of-the-art review of the SMRs is proposed, involving key issues on technological, economic, environmental, and socio-political aspects. Methods of aggregating these factors in order to determine a country’s suitability to invest in SMRs have been explored, while also determining specific areas needing improvement.},

abstract = {International shipping has a well established reputation as the most energy efficient mode of freight transport. However, treating shipping within the context of global environmental concerns has gained significant momentum over the last 10 years, particularly in relation to the generation of Green House Gases (GHG) and other contributions to air and water pollution. Shipping relies on fuel oil and this implies that understanding the potential of alternative non-carbon marine propulsion technologies is necessary as the industry moves forward with its longer term decarbonisation efforts. Without any intend to underestimate the potential environmental and economic benefits of renewable, natural gas or non-fossil (e.g. biofuels) energy resources, it would be only sensible to add on the nuclear engineering option as a possible alternative. As successful as traditional nuclear propulsion has been in the naval and ice breaker ship segments, one aspect of the industry that escaped attention in the commercial sector is the use of modern small and medium size reactor technology on-board ocean going vessels. This paper reviews past and recent work in the area of marine nuclear propulsion and for the purpose of demonstration outlines the technical considerations on the concept design of a Suezmax Tanker powered by the Gen4Energy 70MW Small Modular Reactor (SMR). It is shown that understanding the technical risks and implications of implementing modern nuclear technology is an essential first step in the long term process of developing knowledge and experience.}

abstract = {The utilization of alternative fuels such as LNG, methanol, hydrogen, ammonia, and nuclear energy on marine vessels is quite critical to cope with the challenging air pollution regulations set by IMO and to realize global de-carbonization strategies. Nuclear energy has come to the fore with high and sustainable energy density as well as a carbon-free feature among the other potential alternative maritime fuels. Nuclear energy has been used successfully for icebreakers, submarines, and naval vessels up to now and it has been researched for commercial ships, despite a few unsuccessful projects because nuclear energy brings certain difficulties during its utilization, especially in commercial ships. That’s why a SWOT analysis has been performed to determine all internal and external factors on the utilization of nuclear energy in commercial ships as a maritime fuel. The SWOT factors and sub-factors have been established with the aid of comparable energy studies in the literature and maritime sector reports. Twelve marine experts with an average of 12.8 years of experience have participated in a survey to determine the priority weight of each main and sub-factors. Opportunity and strength aspects have the highest weight with 0.362 and 0.302 respectively. On the other hand, threats have a substantial amount of weight with 0.212. Being eco-friendly, reducing dependency on fossil fuels, and preventing fuel fluctuations constitute the three most prominent features among the sub-factors. However, safety and security challenges, which are 4th place among the sub-factors, should be eliminated as much as possible for successful applications of nuclear energy. Experience gathered from past and existing nuclear-powered marine vessels will have been beneficial to overcome difficulties in the utilization of nuclear energy in commercialships.}

abstract = {This study presents a comprehensive economic and technical feasibility analysis of a 15,000 TEU containership powered by small modular reactor (SMR) technology. The analysis evaluates capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operational expenditures (OPEX) across multiple scenarios, focusing on key factors such as reactor manufacturing costs, nuclear fuel prices, and carbon tax rates. The study also explores the financial implications of leasing versus purchasing the SMR unit, providing a comparison of long-term profitability, cash flow stability, and risk management. Results show that nuclear-powered vessels offer significant long-term cost advantages, particularly in fuel savings and carbon tax reductions, despite their higher initial CAPEX. Leasing the SMR presents an attractive alternative by reducing upfront investment and offering financial flexibility, though at the expense of slightly lower long-term net present value (NPV). This analysis demonstrates the potential benefits of nuclear propulsion in commercial shipping.}
